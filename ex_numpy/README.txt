This is code to explore numpy, pickle, and argparse, written for the 2020 Effective Computing class.

==========================================================

* arrays.py is some parctice with makeing and manipulating arrays in numpy.

Makes informative (?) screen output.

==========================================================

* array_io_with_pickle.py gives an example of how to save a numpy array to disk using the pickle module.  Note that pickle works for any python object, including lists or dicts of other objects.

The code creates, if needed, an output directory, dynamically named like [this_dir]_output.

Output: pmec_output/pickled_array.p

==========================================================

* use_argparse.py is an example of how to use argparse to get your program to accept command line arguments, including Booleans.

==========================================================

* correlation_coef.py shows three ways (with identical results) to calculate the coefficient of correlation "r" between two vectors.

Output: screen plot.

==========================================================

* line_fit.py is an example of doing a linear fit to data, doing it from scratch using linear algebra, and the quick way using np.polyfit().  It also calculates the 95% confidence interval on our estimates of the mean and the slope.

Output: screen plot.
